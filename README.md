# CANBus Triple - The car hacking platform

See [CANBus Triple](http://www.canb.us) for more information, or to purchase hardware.

## About
This repository contains the base firmware and libraries for the CANBus Triple. 

[MCP2515 Library](https://github.com/CANBus-Triple/CANBus-Triple/tree/master/avr/libraries/CANBus/src) | [Examples](https://github.com/CANBus-Triple/CANBus-Triple/tree/master/avr/examples)


## Building
### Arduino IDE
This code is tested with Arduino 1.6.1. [Download](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and install the appropriate file for your platform.

### Get the code
Clone this repo / download to your Arduino [Sketchbook](http://arduino.cc/en/guide/Environment#sketchbook)/hardware folder. The path should look like this

	Documents/Arduino/hardware/CANBus-Triple

To clone:

``git clone https://github.com/CANBus-Triple/CANBus-Triple.git``

 Or download the zip and extract it to your sketchbook folder.

### Setup
Launch the Arduino IDE and select the newly available board variant from the menu bar under **Tools > Board > CANBus Triple**

Open the base sketch by selecting **File > Sketchbook > hardware > CANBus-Triple > avr > CANBusTriple**

This is the basic sketch that talks to the CAN Controllers [MCP2515](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/21801G.pdf), reads CAN packets from them, and routes them through the [Middleware](http://docs.canb.us/firmware/main.html#middleware-system) system.

Assure your CANBus Triple is connected to your PC via the supplied USB cable. Then select the appropriate port from **Tools > Ports**. It will probably say Arduino Leonardo beside the correct port.

Press the Build and Upload button:

The IDE will compile and upload to the CANBus Triple.

If you are upgrading from a version prior to 0.5.0 ensure to do also an EEPROM restore, sending 0x01 0x04 command on serial port.


### Easy Mode

If you simply want to flash the newest firmware build you can use AVRDude or [XLoader](http://russemotto.com/xloader/) for windows to flash the appropriate .hex file to your device. The built firmware files are found in the builds folder of the repo.

Example AVRDude command:
``avrdude -Cavrdude.conf -v -patmega32u4 -cavr109 -P/dev/cu.usbmodem1411 -b57600 -D -Uflash:w:CANBusTriple.cpp.hex:i ``


## Talking over USB Serial

I use [CoolTerm](http://freeware.the-meiers.org/). It is free software available for Linux, MacOS, and Windows. Use the terminal software of your choice.

Connect to your CBT Serial port and you're ready to send commands.

* Send **0x0101** to get general device information.
* Send **0x011001** to get CAN Bus 1 information.
* Send **0x011002** to get CAN Bus 2 information.
* Send **0x011003** to get CAN Bus 3 information.

![CoolTerm](http://res.cloudinary.com/ddbgan4vk/image/upload/w_700/v1424832745/CoolTermCBT_zdm4xz.png)

See [the docs](http://docs.canb.us/firmware/api.html) for available commands.



## Desktop / Mobile app

A hybrid web app for Android, iOS, Windows, and MacOS is in development and will be available soon.
